An interactive javascript web application for guessing the mashup of two characters, generated externally.

[View on Github Pages](https://drraccoony.github.io/aiGuessr/)

## Running Application

This is a very light weight application and only requires a web browser with Javascript support. No external dependencies or databases needed. You can even view the current github build [here on Github Pages](https://drraccoony.github.io/aiGuessr/).

## Adding Items

New generations and images can be added by placing the image in the directory, and updating the json with the appropriate details.

1. Place your image within `/img` directory, with a somewhat descriptive filename.
2. Open `src/js/mashup.json` in your favorite text editor.
3. Following the object format, add a new json object, maintaining the existing keys, if a keyword can be guessed in different keywords, you can use an array in place of a string (Thanks JTJutajoh!)

    ```json
    "id": 0,
    "keyword1": "Mario",
    "keyword2": [
                "Seinfeld",
                "Jerry Seinfeld"
            ],
    "image": "MarioAndSeinfeld.png",
    "hint": "Whats the deal with koopas?!"
    ```

4. An optional `hint` key can be added.
